## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow of:

- Downloading and preparing image data (from Kaggle).
- Building and training a CNN for binary classification.
- Evaluating performance with loss and accuracy metrics.
- Predicting and visualizing the classification of new images.
